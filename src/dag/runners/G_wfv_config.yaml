walk_forward:
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Minimum number of observations required before the first validation
  # window is evaluated.
  #
  # Purpose:
  # - Ensures models have sufficient historical context before scoring.
  # - Too small → noisy, unstable metrics.
  # - Too large → too few validation windows.
  #
  # Current phase (bootstrap / CPU / ~10 equities):
  # - Set lower to allow multiple walk-forward splits.
  #
  min_train_size: 1000


  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Size of each validation window (number of observations).
  #
  # Purpose:
  # - Defines how many future points are used to evaluate performance
  #   at each walk-forward step.
  # - Larger windows reduce variance but reduce temporal resolution.
  #
  # Constraint:
  # - Must be > 0
  # - Must be < total dataset size - min_train_size
  #
  val_size: 200


  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Step size between consecutive walk-forward windows.
  #
  # Purpose:
  # - Controls how far the window advances each iteration.
  # - Smaller step → more overlap → smoother stability estimates.
  # - Larger step → fewer evaluations, higher variance.
  #
  # Best practice:
  # - Typically equal to or slightly smaller than val_size.
  #
  step_size: 200


  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Maximum allowable mean RMSE across all walk-forward windows
  # for a model to be considered eligible.
  #
  # Purpose:
  # - Enforces absolute performance quality.
  # - Acts as the first hard gate before stability is considered.
  #
  # Interpretation:
  # - Model must be "good on average", not just occasionally.
  #
  # Bootstrap phase note:
  # - Relaxed relative to production due to limited scale.
  #
  max_mean_rmse: 2.5 #0.08


  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Minimum required stability score for eligibility.
  #
  # Stability score definition:
  #   stability_score = 1 / (1 + std_rmse)
  #
  # Purpose:
  # - Penalizes models with high variance across time.
  # - Explicitly discourages temporally unstable models.
  #
  # Interpretation:
  # - Higher is better.
  # - Values close to 1 imply very stable performance.
  #
  # Bootstrap phase note:
  # - Lowered to allow moderately volatile but useful models.
  #
  min_stability_score: 0.38 #0.35
